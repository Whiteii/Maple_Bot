# Maple Bot


Presently, the development of this bot is ongoing. I am currently working on integrating YOLOv8 to establish a gym environment. A gym environment is a framework where the agent can undergo training based on past experiences to enhance its intelligence. This approach enables the agent to learn and improve its gameplay over time.
