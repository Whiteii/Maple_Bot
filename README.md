# Maple Bot

Presently, the development of this bot is ongoing. I am currently working on integrating YOLOv8 to establish a gym environment. A gym environment is a framework where the agent can undergo training based on past experiences to enhance its intelligence. This approach enables the agent to learn and improve its gameplay over time.

## OpenCV for template matching

            Before, I had utilized OpenCV template matching and encountered various limitations, particularly in the detection of non-playable characters (NPCs). Now, I have opted to proceed with YOLOv8, and the performance is significantly improved.

## Yolov8
Currently, I am implementing YOLOv8 to capture faces of monsters and my character's position on the minimap. Additionally, there is a green circle on the minimap indicating a certain aspect of the environment.

  <p>In the present implementation of YOLOv8, there are anticipated changes in the future. Instead of identifying the entire body of an NPC, the system will be configured to specifically detect their faces.</p>
