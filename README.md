# Maple Bot

Presently, the development of this bot is ongoing. I am currently working on integrating YOLOv8 to establish a gym environment. A gym environment is a framework where the agent can undergo training based on past experiences to enhance its intelligence. This approach enables the agent to learn and improve its gameplay over time.

## OpenCV for template matching

            Before, I had utilized OpenCV template matching and encountered various limitations, particularly in the detection of non-playable characters (NPCs). Now, I have opted to proceed with YOLOv8, and the performance is significantly improved.

Currently, I am implementing YOLOv8 to capture faces of monsters and my character's position on the minimap. Additionally, there is a green circle on the minimap indicating a certain aspect of the environment.
